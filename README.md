# pairings
In Scrabble tournaments, various types of pairings are used to determine which players compete against each other in each round. The choice of pairing system can vary depending on the tournament's format and the number of participants. Here are some common types of Scrabble tournament pairings:

## Round Robin:
 In a Round Robin tournament, each player competes against every other player in the tournament exactly once. The pairings are set so that everyone plays everyone else, and the player with the most wins at the end is declared the winner.

## Swiss System: 
The Swiss System is commonly used in larger Scrabble tournaments. Players are paired based on their current ranking and performance. In the first round, players are paired randomly. After the first round, players with similar records are matched against each other. The system tries to ensure that players face opponents of roughly equal skill throughout the tournament.

## King of the Hill:
 In a King of the Hill tournament, the player or team at the top of the standings faces off against challengers. If the challenger wins, they become the new "King of the Hill" and face the next challenger. This continues until a set number of rounds or until a player reaches a predefined number of wins.

## Double Round Robin:
 In this format, each player faces every other player in the tournament twice, once as the first player and once as the second player. This helps to balance the effects of drawing tiles in Scrabble.

## Single Elimination: 
In a single-elimination tournament, players are paired up, and the loser of each match is eliminated from the tournament. The winner advances to the next round until a single champion remains.

## Modified Swiss System:
 This is a hybrid system that combines elements of the Swiss system and Round Robin. Players typically play a set number of games against opponents with similar records, but they may not face every other player in the tournament.

## Bracketed Tournaments: 
Some Scrabble tournaments use a bracket system, similar to the NCAA basketball tournament. Players are seeded into brackets, and they compete in a knockout-style competition, with winners advancing to the next round.
